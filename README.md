# TQNet: a CNN for tone quality evaluation

Pytorch implementation of the paper Tone Quality Evaluation for Woodwind Music Instrument Based on Reed-Pulse Features

## 1. Reed-pulse signal (RPMelspec) feature extraction

You can extract the proposed reed-pulse signal feature by running ```data_preprocessing.py```.

## 2.  Tone quality network training and testing

Run ``` train_TQNet.py```

## 3. Effectiveness of transfer learning

Run ``` sax2instruments_gs.py``` to test the transfer learning results on Good-sounds dataset.# ToneQualityEvaluation
